          In November, 2022, Greenfield received a long term subordinated Capex
          facility of $500k for 7 years from Kampani, a social impact investment organization
          from Belgium. The purpose of the facility is to purchase Trucks, Construct a
          Warehouse and purchase Spraying machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kampani’s investment will help Greenfield to reach out to over 25,000 smallholder
          farmers within the next 5 years. The purchase of new Pick-Ups will help increase
          Greenfield’s transport and distribution capacity and reach out to more smallholder
          farmers in the villages to increase its farmer base.
        </p>
        <p>
          The construction of the warehouse will also help Greenfield to better manage input
          stocks affected by price fluctuation. The purchase of spraying machines will also
          help provide a new service and additional income stream to Greenfield by
          renting the machines to farmers who cannot afford to buy them.
